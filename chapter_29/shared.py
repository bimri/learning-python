'''
Assignments to instance attributes create or change the names in the instance, rather
than in the shared class. More generally, inheritance searches occur only on attribute
references, not on assignment: assigning to an objectâ€™s attribute always changes that
object, and no other.

For example, y.spam is looked up in the class by inheritance, but
the assignment to x.spam attaches a name to x itself.
