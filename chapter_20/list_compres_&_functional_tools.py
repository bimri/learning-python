'''
Python has a host of tools that most would consider `functional`
    - closures, generators, lambdas, comprehensions, maps,
    - decorators, function objects, map, filter, reduce, etc.

Tools allow for co,binations in powerful ways, and often offer
state retention & coding solutions that are alternatives to classes
and OOP

"Lisp compres were inspired from similar tools from Haskell"


"List compres apply arbitrary expression to items in an iterable,"
"rather than applying a function; thus more general a tool"


"List compre extended to other tools - sets, dictionaries,"
"even the value generator expressions"
