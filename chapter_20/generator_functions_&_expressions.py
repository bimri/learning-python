"Python supports `procrastination`"
'''
it provides tools that produce results only when needed, 
instead of all at once
'''

# like map and zip that produce items on demand
'Generator functions'
"Coded as general defs but with a *yield statement"
"to return results one at a time, suspending & resuming thier state between each"

'Generator expressions'
"similar to list comprehensions; but they return an object that produces results"
"on demand instead of building a result list"


'''
Because neither constructs a result list all at once, they save memory space and allow
computation time to be split across result requests.

Pythonâ€™s notion of generators
owes much to other programming languages, especially `Icon`.
