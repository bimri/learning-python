"Recursion versus queues and stacks"
'''
Python implements recursion by
pushing information on a call stack at each recursive call, so it remembers where it must
return and continue later

possible to implement recursive-style
procedures without recursive calls

using an explicit stack or queue of your own to
keep track of remaining steps
'''

# forming a first-in-first-out queue.
