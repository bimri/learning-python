'''
Technically, instance creation first triggers the __new__ method, which
creates and returns the new instance object, which is then passed into
__init__ for initialization. Since __new__ has a built-in implementation
and is redefined in only very limited roles, though, nearly all Python
classes initialize by defining an __init__ method.

Weâ€™ll see one use case
for __new__ when we study metaclasses in Chapter 40; though rare, it is
sometimes also used to customize creation of instances of mutable
types.
