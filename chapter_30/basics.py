"Operator Overloading"
'''
operator overloading” simply means intercepting built-in operations in a class’s
methods
    — Python automatically invokes your methods when instances of the class
appear in built-in operations, and your method’s return value becomes the result of the
corresponding operation.
    • Operator overloading lets classes intercept normal Python operations.
    • Classes can overload all Python expression operators.
    • Classes can also overload built-in operations such as printing, function calls, attribute
    access, etc.
    • Overloading makes class instances act more like built-in types.
    • Overloading is implemented by providing specially named methods in a class.
