"Bound Methods and Other Callable Objects"
'''
bound methods can be processed as generic objects, just like
simple functionsâ€”they can be passed around a program arbitrarily

because bound methods combine both a function and an instance in a single package, they can
be treated like any other callable object and require no special syntax when invoked.

"""
Like simple functions, bound method objects have introspection information of their
own, including attributes that give access to the instance object and method function
they pair. Calling the bound method simply dispatches the pair:
"""
bound = x.double
print(bound.__self__, bound.__func__)
print(bound.__self__.base)
print(bound())                                              # Calls bound.__func__(bound.__self__, ...)
