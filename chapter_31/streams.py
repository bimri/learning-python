Rather than using a simple function here, we might code this as a class that uses composition
to do its work in order to provide more structure and support inheritance.

"""
Coded this way, reader and writer objects
are embedded within the class instance (composition), and we supply the conversion
logic in a subclass rather than passing in a converter function (inheritance).
