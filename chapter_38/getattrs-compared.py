"""
When run, the __getattr__ version intercepts only attr3 accesses, because it is undefined.
The __getattribute__ version, on the other hand, intercepts all attribute fetches
and must route those it does not manage to the superclass fetcher to avoid loops:

Although __getattribute__ can catch more attribute fetches than __getattr__, in practice
they are often just variations on a themeâ€”if attributes are not physically stored,
the two have the same effect.
