"printing the value of __name__ at the top here to trace its value."
'''
Python creates and assigns this usage-mode variable as soon as it starts loading a file. When we run
this file as a top-level script, its name is set to __main__, so its self-test code kicks in
automatically:

    c:\code> python minmax2.py
    I am: __main__
    16


If we import the file, though, its name is not __main__, so we must explicitly call the
function to make it run:

    c:\code> python
    >>> import minmax2
    I am: minmax2
    >>> minmax2.minmax(minmax2.lessthan, 's', 'p', 'a', 'a')
    'a'

Again, regardless of whether this is used for testing, the net effect is that we get to use
our code in two different rolesâ€”as a library module of tools, or as an executable program.
