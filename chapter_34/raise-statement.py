"The raise Statement"
'''
To trigger exceptions explicitly, you can code raise statements. Their general form is
simpleâ€”a raise statement consists of the word raise, optionally followed by the class
to be raised or an instance of it:
'''
raise instance              # raise instance of class           
raise klass                 # Make and raise instance of class; makes an instance 
raise                       # Re-raise last exception(most recent exception)


# exceptions are always instances of classes 
# first raise form here is the most common
# raise is a statement, so it can be used anywhere
