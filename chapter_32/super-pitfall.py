""" 
If such classes later grow to use more than one superclass, though, super can become
error-prone, and even unusableâ€”it does not raise an exception for multiple inheritance
trees, but will naively pick just the leftmost superclass having the method being run
(technically, the first per the MRO), which may or may not be the one that you want:

        super().act()                                               # Doesn't fail on multi-inher, but picks just one!

this silently masks the fact that you should probably be selecting superclasses
explicitly in this case, super usage may obscure a common source of errors in Python
