"User-Defined Exceptions"
'''
User-defined exceptions are coded with classes, which inherit from a built-in exception class: 
usually the class named Exception:
'''
class AlreadyGotOne(Exception):                             # User-defined exception class
    pass

def grail():
    raise AlreadyGotOne()                                   # Raise an instance


try:
    grail()
except AlreadyGotOne:
    print('You already got the grail!')


""" 
Class-based exceptions allow scripts to build exception categories,
which can inherit behavior, and have attached state information and methods. They
can also customize their error message text displayed if theyâ€™re not caught:
""" 
class Career(Exception):
    def __str__(self): return 'So I became a waiter...'


raise Career()                                              # Raise an instance
